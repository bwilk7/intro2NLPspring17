	   <p>
		The focus of this assignment will be to gain experience building and using language models.
    It is made up of 6 parts as follows. Please pay attention to the different requirements based on
    the course number you are enrolled in. You are free to use any language you like, as long as it
    runs on GL. There is no specific coding standard, but please make your code readable.

    If you use any language that requires compilation please include the appropriate Makefile, Ant script, etc.
    In addition, all submissions must have a README.md that describes how to run and use your program(s).

The repository for this assignment is hw1. To accept the assignment and create your specific repository, go to <a href="https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/2d22885526d083e1eb2b2a0ffb6c903d">https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/2d22885526d083e1eb2b2a0ffb6c903d</a>.

    <p class="subtitle is-3">Part 1: Reading the Data (10 Points)</p>
     <p>
       The first part of any statistical NLP application is read in the corpus. For this assignment,
       your program should take a command line argument that is the location of a text file. This text
       file is a bit messy, the sentences are not segmented by line. For this first part, you need to
       read in the text and segment it into setnences and words. The accuracy of your segmentation method
       is not important, and you will not be graded on it. Please list any assumptions you make and how you
       segment your data as part of your README. To train you model you should use the file /afs/umbc.edu/users/b/w/bwilk1/pub/assignment1.corpus located on GL. I reccomend reading it directly from this location as it is 39M. 


     </p>

     <p class="subtitle is-3">Part 2: Bulding a Simple N-gram Language Model (20 Points)</p>
     <p>
       For this part of the assignment, you need to build a simple N-gram Model, with no
       smoothing or other techniques to deal with 0s. You can not use any existing NLP libraries
       to do this, although you are permitted to use any mathematical libraries you wish, which
       may make storing the counts easier.
     </p>
     <p class="subtitle is-4">For CMSC 473 Students:</p>
     <p>
       <ul>
         <li>
           You N-gram model should use bigrams
         </li>
       </ul>
     </p>
     <p class="subtitle is-4">For CMSC 673 Students:</p>
     <p>
       <ul>
         <li>
           You N-gram model should use trigrams
         </li>
       </ul>
     </p>


     <p class="subtitle is-3">Part 3: Smoothing your Language Model (20 Points)</p>
     <p>
       As we have discussed in class, having counts of 0 and thus probabilities of 0 is not ideal in a LM. For
       this part of the assignment you need to implement a smoothed version of your language model. I suggest
       adding this to the same program as the one used to build the simple N-gram model, but make sure to save
       the simple model somehow before you smooth your model. For this part everyone will implement Good-Turing
       smoothing.
     </p>
     <p class="subtitle is-4">Note:</p>
     <p>
       Don't forget that when using GT smoothing some bins may have a a count of zero. You are free to remedy this
       anyway you see fit, but the simplest is to use the counts of the surrounding bins and estimate it as a a percentage of
       the two. For example, if you have a value for N<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>6</sub>, but not N<sub>5</sub>, you can set N<sub>5</sub> to N<sub>4</sub> + N<sub>6</sub> / 2. If you
       have values for N<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>7</sub>, but neither N<sub>5</sub> or N<sub>6</sub>, you should set N<sub>5</sub> to be 1/3 * (N<sub>7</sub>-N<sub>4</sub>) + N<sub>4</sub>, while N<sub>6</sub> should be
       2/3 * (N<sub>7</sub>-N<sub>4</sub>) + N<sub>4</sub>. Again how you do this is not important as long as your program runs with out errors, and you document
       your decision in your README file.
     </p>

     <p class="subtitle is-3">Part 4: Using Interpoloation or Backoff (30 Points)</p>
     <p>
       In this part of the assignment, you must use either simple interpolation or
       backoff to further improve your language model. Which you use depends on the
       course you are registered for.
     </p>
     <p class="subtitle is-4">For CMSC 473 Students:</p>
     <p>
       <ul>
         <li>
           You should implement simple interpolation between the bigram and unigram models.
           The weights are up to you, just document them and make sure they add up to 1.
         </li>
       </ul>
     </p>
     <p class="subtitle is-4">For CMSC 673 Students:</p>
     <p>
       <ul>
         <li>
           You should Katz Backoff, as outlined in section 2.4 of <a href="http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~yogo/courses/mt2013/papers/chen-goodman-99.pdf">An empirical study of smoothing techniques for language modeling</a> This may be tricky to implement, so start early. 
         </li>
       </ul>
     </p>

    <p class="subtitle is-3">Part 5: Claculate Perplexity (10 Points)</p>
    <p>
      Write a program that calcluate the perlexity of a language model. The program should take two arguments,
      the location of the saved langauge model, and a text file that has already been run through your
      segementation program. Using the text file /afs/umbc.edu/users/b/w/bwilk1/pub/assignment1.corpus.test as your test set, report your perplexities in your README for your
      3 language models.
    </p>



    <p class="subtitle is-3">Part 6: Short Analysis (10 Points)</p>
    <div class="content">
    <p>
      Run the following sentence pairs in each of your language models. For each sentence pair discuss the differences in probabilties produced and which you think makes more sense. This can be placed in your README.md
	<ul>
		<li>Many people live on the west coast. Many people live on the east coast.</li>
		<li>Deep creek lake is in western Maryland. The Appalachians are in western Maryland</li>
	        <li>The Patriots won Super Bowl LI. The Patriots won Super Bow XXXVI</li>
	</ul>
    </p>
    </div>
    <p class="subtitle is-3">What to Turn In</p>
    <p>
	For this assignment turn in a README.md describing any outside sources you used as well as assumptions you made. In addition turn in all code and your 3 language models. We may test your code with a different corpus as well. Your language model code can take in any arugments you want, as long as they are documented. I reccomend that your smoothing code take as an arugment your unsmoothed language model so that you don't have to do all the data processing and counting again.
