            <p class='content'>
                Natural language processing (NLP), the first non-numerical application of computing, was first studied more than 60 years ago. The ultimate goal of NLP is to enable computers to communicate with people the same way that people communicate among themselves.
                To do so, the computers must be able to understand and generate text. The course will introduce the students to the problems, methods, and applications of NLP.

                By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC's scholarly community in which everyone's academic work and behavior are held to the highest standards of honesty. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism,
                and helping others to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong. Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to, suspension or dismissal.

                    Here is some guidance on what we expect from you. Some of this was adopted from David Matuszek's policies at UPenn.
                    <br /> You may:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Discuss the assignments with one another.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    If you don't understand something about the assignment, ask.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The best people to ask are the instructor and TA, but there is no harm in talking to other students about the assignments.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Help others debug their work.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Sometimes other people will notice immediately something that you have spent hours trying to find. Maybe they've had the same problem. Being "stuck" for long periods is not a good way to learn.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    More often than not, your errors become obvious when you try to explain your program to someone else. The other person doesn't even have to be a programmer; in fact, it's probably better if they aren't a programmer. It's often said that explaining your
                                    program to your dog can be a big help.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If you help someone else, don't overdo it--don't write their program for them. Help them understand their errors and how to fix them, but don't do it for them. Teach them how to catch a fish rather than buying them a flounder and cooking it with a white
                                    wine sauce.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If someone is helping you, do not let them take a copy of your program. Not everyone is honest.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use, without attribution, anything we post to the Web.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    If we post it, it's so that you can use it. We will know where it came from.

                                <li>
                                    However, it's an important habit in general to give credit to any source that you "borrow" code from -- it's the honest thing to do
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    You may not:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Work together on the same program.
                            <ul>
                                <li>We emphasize this one because this is where we always hear, "but I didn't understand."</li>
                                <li>Talking about the program is fine, but when it comes to writing the program, do it by yourself. </li>
                                <li>Writing programs jointly is unacceptable. You will very probably be caught and that will be grounds for failing the course. </li>
                                <li>If you write a program jointly and try to hide the fact by making cosmetic changes, this will be regarded as further evidence that you know the rules and are being deliberately dishonest. </li>
                                <li>Working together may be acceptable in your home culture, and it is usually encouraged in business; it but working together is not acceptable in this educational system. </li>
                                <li>If you discuss your assignment extensively with another student, and make reasonably detailed plans about how you will do it, and then go off and each write each program separately, you will be surprised at how different
                                    they turn out. We have never had a problem with programs that were "accidentally" the same. </li>

                                <li>Please be careful with your disks, flash drives and your program listings. Please. </li>
                                <li>If you lose a disk, just tell us. Tell us right away. So long as we know about it before we discover that someone else has turned in the same program, you won't be in any trouble. </li>

                                <li>Let's be clear. There is no problem with looking up how to do something, and copying two or three lines to, say, open a file, or create a Frame. Even an entire method of, say, ten lines, should be OK -- particularly if
                                    it's a general-purpose thing that might be used in a lot of different programs.</li>
                                <li>Finding code that does a significant part of your assignment, and using it, particularly if you use it without attribution, is a violation. </li>
                                <li>For the most part, it should be pretty obvious what is assignment-specific and what is general-purpose. If in doubt, ask me. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Have someone else write your program for you.
                            <ul>
                                <li>This one is pretty obvious.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                    If you think you may have accidentally broken a rule, come and talk to us about it. You will be much better off than if we discover it ourselves.
